## **📌 Project: Intelligent Resume Parser & ATS Optimizer**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Develop a smart system that extracts key details from resumes, evaluates compatibility with job descriptions, and optimizes resumes for ATS compliance.
---

## **🔹 1. Professional Requirements List**

### **1️⃣ Technical Requirements**

✅ **Programming Language:** Python (with focus on regex for text parsing)  
✅ **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, regex, NLTK/SpaCy, Scikit-learn, OpenAI API (optional for AI enhancements)  
✅ **Databases:** SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing resumes & job descriptions)  
✅ **Deployment:** Flask/FastAPI for API integration, Docker for containerization  
✅ **Cloud Integration:** AWS/GCP for scalability (optional)

### **2️⃣ Functional Requirements**

✅ **Resume Parsing Engine:** Extracts key details (name, skills, experience, education) using NLP & regex  
✅ **ATS Optimization Module:** Scores resumes based on job description relevance  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides resume recommendations & optimization tips  
✅ **Job Matching Algorithm:** Uses ML models to predict resume-job fit

### **3️⃣ Performance & Scalability**

✅ **Processing Speed:** Optimized regex & NLP pipelines for high-speed parsing  
✅ **Compatibility:** Works with common resume formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)  
✅ **Security:** Ensure **GDPR compliance** for handling sensitive resume data
